## Goal

The goal of this documentation is to provide a clear and concise centralized information regarding JENSEN products and services. Specifically pertaining to FUTURAIL & Washer Technologies.

These goals should be:

- Easy to understand.
- Actionable.
- Achievable.
- Measurable.

The aim is to:

- Define the product.
- Break down the features of the product.
- Set the goals for the development process.
- Set the goals for the release process.
- Eventually...Set the goals for the future.

It is necessary to find the right balance between excessive and no documentation at all. When documentation is poor, it causes errors which reduces the efficiency of the product development. At the same time, you have to ensure that the document is concise and information is not repeated. The aim is not to document _every_ piece of information only the necessary and relevant. While trying to find the right balance, we'll be able to simplify the system for all.

## Getting Started

Firstly, I know this won't be easy and will take some time to collect the necessary information. Our team is busy, so we'll try to make this as easy as possible. We'll start by collecting the easier to obtain information: How To on Forms, Handover Procedures, Testing, Safety Logic, and JENSEN Acronyms.

Once we have a firm grasp on documenting we can move on to more complex items like:
